2. Nc3 Nf6
3. Nf3 Nc6
4. d4 exd4
5. Nxd4 Bb4
6. Bg5 h6
7. Bh4 g5
; Unexpected but a stroke that is characteristic of the German player
8. Bg3 d6
9. Rc1 Nxd4
; Better would have been 9.e3 or 9.f3
10. Qxd4 Bf5
11. h4 Kd7 
; ? A considerable loss of time. 
; 11.f3 would be better.! Intrepid and well inspired. If now 12.Be5 then 12...Bc5 13.Bxf6 Bxd4 14.Bxd8 Raxd8 with advantage to Black.
12. Rd1 Ne4
13. Qe5 Bxc3+
14. bxc3 Nxg3
15. fxg3 Bg6
; Also after 15.Qxg3 b6 Black would have the better game.
16. hxg5 Qxg5
; At this moment White has some counter-attacking chances and Keres makes use of them with the ingenious spirit in which he specializes. This opportunity could be avoided by means of 16...hxg5 
; 17.Rxh8 Qxh8 and White's disorganized pawns would guarantee Black a good endgame.
17. Qf4 Rae8
18. Rd5 Qxf4
; ! Forcing the undoubling of one of the pawns.

26. Rxh4 Kc5
27. Bf3 Bxf3
28. Kxf3 Kxc4
; In spite of all his efforts, the White king has not succeeded in counter-balancing all the advantages that his rival obtained in the opening. However, as we shall see later on, this advantage should not be decisive.

37. f5 a5
38. Kxd6 Kc4
; ? The decisive mistake. Instead of this unfortunate move, necessary was 38.Kd4 with good chances of salvation. Let us look at two principal variations: (a)38...Rg8 39.Rg2! c2 40.Rxc2 Rxg5 41.Kd5 Rg4 42.Re2 Kc3 43.Kxd6 Kd3 44.Rf2. (b)38...a4

45. Rxc3+ Kxc3
46. f7 b2
47. g7 b1=Q
48. f8=Q Qb7+

49. Kxe6 Ra6+
50. Ke5 Qb5+
51. Kf4 Ra4+
52. Kg3 Qd3+
53. Qf3 Ra8
54. g8=Q Rxg8+
; Here or on the previous move exchanging queens would have sufficed.
55. Kh2 Rh8+
56. Kg1 Rg8+
; A king that does not want to resign!
