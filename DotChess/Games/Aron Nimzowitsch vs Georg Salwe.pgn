1. e4 e6
2. d4 d5
3. e5 c5
4. c3 Nc6
5. Nf3 Qb6
6. Bd3 Bd7
{ More natural would have been 6 Be2, for the pawn at d4 is the "base", and as such should be protected as thoroughly as possible. Be2 "protects" more thoroughly than Bd3. }
{ A very plausible move. Since White still delays ...dxc5, Black intends his hand with ...Rc8. the right course was 6...csd4 7 cxd4 and thus to pass into quite other channels. See Paulsen-Tarrash, 1888 and Nimzowitsch-Tarrasch, 1912. }
7. dxc5 Bxc5!!
8. O-O f6
{ Black swells in triumph and throws himself hungrily on the last remaining menber of the once so proud chain-family, top destroy him. His war cry is "Room for the e-pawn!" But it happens quite otherwise. }
9. b4 Be7
{ In order to be able to provide his e5 with an enduring defence. }
{ 9 Qe2 would also have been a defence, but no enduring one, for there would follow 9... }
{ fxe5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Qxe5 Nf6 and the blockading queen at e5 will be easily driven away. }
10. Bf4 fxe5
{ Again we have the exchange operation which we have so often discussed; }
{ this time however, it is not really justified, for the new blockader, the bishop at e5, proves to be a stout fellow. }
11. Nxe5 Nxe5
12. Bxe5 Nf6
{ For the otherwise desirable ...Bf6 would fail against 13 Qh5+ g6 14 Bxg6+ hxg6 15 Qxg6+ Ke7 16 Bxf6+ Nxf6 17 Qg7+. }
13. Nd2 O-O
{ If 13 Qc2? O-O 14 Bxf6 Rxf6 15 Bxh7+ Kh8 16 Bg6 (or Bd3) e5!, White it is true has won a pawn, but black has overcome the blockade, and now stands ready to march in the center. White should lose. }
14. Nf3 Bd6
{ ! The blockading forces are to be reinforced by the knight. }
{ 14...Bb5 would yield little profit, for 15 Bd4 Qa6 16 Bxb5 Qxb5 17 Ng5 would win a pawn. }
15. Qe2 Rac8
{ The manouver 15 Bd4 Qc7 16 Qe2 might be considered with the intention of following with 17 Ne5. However, this plan to widen the blockading ring is impracticable, for, after 16 Qe2 Ng4!! 17 h3 e5!, the Black pawns assert themselves whatever counterchances be taken. }
16. Bd4 Qc7
17. Ne5 Be8
; The immobility of the e-pawn is now greater than ever. White has utilized his resources very economically. The possibility of a successful occupation of the points d4, e5, hung on a hair, on taking advantage of the terrain (the points d4, e5, c2 and e2.
18. Rae1 Bxe5
19. Bxe5 Qc6
20. Bd4 Bd7
; In order to force Black's queen bishop, who also has his eye on h5, to come to a decision.
21. Qc2 Rf7
; the decisive re-grouping.
22. Re3 b6
23. Rg3 Kh8
